- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation
  - `nltk` – for natural language processing
  - `matplotlib` – for visualizations
  - `wordcloud` – for visualizing frequent terms

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Dataset: Customer support ticket records from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset)
- Columns included:
  - Ticket ID, Customer Info, Ticket Description, Resolution, Priority, etc.
- Focused analysis was done on the `Ticket Description` column.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization using `nltk`.

2. **Word Frequency Analysis**
   - Extracted top 20 most common keywords from ticket descriptions.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar chart of top 20 issue keywords
   - Word cloud of recurring problem terms
